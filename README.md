Function Overriding in Java:-

- When function name is same in different classes is called function overriding.
- example1: in this example both function are same to same, so compiler learn that class function, whose class object you create in main class.

- example 2: in this example function name is same but in one function is parameterise and other one is not. so when you pass argument in main class while calling function then parameterise function run, other wise simple or non parameterise function will run.

- example 3: when in one function we pass double type parameter and in other we pass int type parameter. when in main class we pass int type argument then that function will run who receives int type data, when double type argument will pass then function which receives double type data will run.
